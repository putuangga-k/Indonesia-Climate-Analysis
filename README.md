# Indonesia-Climate-Analysis

This section is dedicated to an in-depth analysis of the “Climate Data Daily IDN” dataset. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of various climate parameters recorded daily across different regions in Indonesia.

The dataset includes variables such as:

- Daily Maximum Temperature (Tx): The highest temperature recorded in a day.
- Daily Minimum Temperature (Tn): The lowest temperature recorded in a day.
- Daily Average Temperature (Tavg): The average temperature recorded in a day.
- Daily Rainfall (RR): The amount of rainfall recorded in a day.
- Maximum Daily Humidity (RH_max): The highest humidity level recorded in a day.
- Minimum Daily Humidity (RH_min): The lowest humidity level recorded in a day.
- Max Wind Speed (ff_x): The maximum wind speed recorded in a day.
- Wind Direction at Maximum Speed (ddd_x): The direction of the wind when the maximum speed was recorded.
- Average Wind Speed (ff_avg): The average wind speed recorded in a day.
- Most Wind Direction (ddd_car): The most frequent wind direction recorded in a day.

Through this analysis, we aim to uncover patterns and trends in the climate data, understand the relationships between different climate parameters, and gain insights that could be valuable for various applications, from weather forecasting to climate change research.
